# Portfolio Configuration for FinancePortfolio by Jeroen Bouma (JerBouma)
# With this configuration, you are able to get a complete overview of 
# your investment portfolio over time.

general:
  # The location of the file(s) that contain the portfolio data. This can be a single file
  # or a directory. If it is a directory, all files in the directory will be read. Ensure
  # that the files use the same format in that case.
  file_location: examples/portfolio

  # Whether to adjust for duplicates. This can be the case if you do the same trade multiple
  # times on a day at the same price. These are then grouped together.
  adjust_duplicates: true

  # The columns that represent the date. Can be a list to allow for more robustness in case
  # you wish to change the format.
  date_columns:
    - Datum
    - Date
    - Day Of Year

  # The format to use for the dates, needs to be specific to your transaction data and is
  # highly relevant for grouping data together. See https://strftime.org/ for more information.
  date_format: "%d/%m/%Y"

  # The columns that include the ticker of the transaction. This is an important column to be able
  # to collect historical data
  ticker_columns:
    - ISIN
    - Ticker
    - Symbol
    - Code
  
  # The columns that include the name of the transaction. This is an optional column and will use
  # the ticker column instead if nothing can be found.
  name_columns:
    - Product
    - Name
    - Naam

  # The price column is used to determine the price of the transaction. This is used to calculate
  # the value of the transaction and the performance of the transaction.
  price_columns:
    - Koers
    - Price
    - Prijs

  # The volume column is used to determine the volume of the transaction. This is used to calculate
  # the value of the transaction and the performance of the transaction.
  volume_columns:
    - Aantal
    - Volume

  # The costs column is used to deduct any costs from the transaction. This is used to calculate
  # the value of the transaction and the performance of the transaction. This is an optional column
  # and is set to 0 if nothing can be found.
  costs_columns:
    - Transactiekosten en/of
    - Costs
    - Transaction Costs

  # This defines how the columns should be mapped as described above. This is used to normalize
  # the dataset in such a way that it can be used for further processing but also so that the
  # model can take multiple (different) portfolio files. E.g. if you invest with different
  # brokers, the model should be flexible enough to group these together.
  column_mapping:
    date: Date
    ticker: Ticker

  # This is the overall benchmark used when there is no benchmark ticker specified
  # for a specific ticker (see below). Defaults to ^GSPC (S&P 500 Index)
  benchmark_ticker: ^GSPC

  # This gives the option to provide benchmarks for each individual ticker. This is
  # useful when you wish to see the performance of a product compared to a specific
  # benchmark instead. For the ones not provided, it defaults back to the benchmark ticker.

  # This parameter determines whether you'd like to see tickers that are entirely sold
  # off in the portfolio. If you set this to true, you will not see the tickers that you
  # have zero volume in the Portfolio Overview.
  exclude_sold_tickers: false # CURRENTLY INACTIVE

  # When working with ISIN codes, it is preferable to convert them to ticker symbols
  # e.g. IE0031442068 to UST.PA instead of NASD.L. Both are the same product but denoted
  # in a different currency. Defining these here ensures that it matches up well with
  # your portfolio.

  # This can be either a string (e.g. currency: EUR) or a list of strings which
  # represents columns and is used to determine the currency of a transaction.
  # This needs to be 3 letters, e.g. EUR, USD or JPY. This is relevant when
  # converting ISIN to ticker symbols to acquire historical data when the above parameter
  # is not defined.
  currency_columns:
    - "Unnamed: 8" # Specifically for the DEGIRO export given the currency column has no header

    - Currency

  # This reflects the currency of the portfolio. This is used to convert each transaction to
  # the same currency if applicable. This must be 3 letters, e.g. EUR, USD or JPY. If you do
  # not want to convert currencies, set this to False but do keep in mind that aggregations
  # of a portfolio in multiple currencies are not entirely correct.
